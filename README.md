# Battle Facilities Pokédex

This project consists on an interactive database which collects every Pokémon set that can be used by Battle Frontier (PtHGSS) and Battle Subway (BW) trainers, with a search bar that allows filtering the sets by move, item, Pokémon name, nature, trainer name or trainer class. 

Sets and moves data is gathered in JSON files which have been generated by scraping [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/) with Python scripts. Item and Pokémon icons have been extracted from [Lewtwo](https://x.com/Lewchube)'s [Pokémon Asset Archive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16bSaqcst0tOMsz4rGBzPK_iZvgx4DZJX). 

See [this page](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Battle_Frontier_Trainers_in_Generation_IV) and [this page](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Battle_Subway_Trainers) for further information about Battle Frontier trainers in Pokémon Platinum, HeartGold and SoulSilver and Battle Subway Trainers in Pokémon Black and White.
